## CSIH: Contrastive signed-intent hypergraph learning for gene-drug interaction sign prediction

### This repository contains the official PyTorch implementation of the CSIH model (based on the framework originally titled DiSign).CSIH is a robust graph neural network framework designed for Signed Bipartite Graphs. It is particularly effective for tasks like Gene-Drug interaction prediction, where it disentangles latent intents (e.g., biological pathways or mechanisms) behind interactions.

## 📖 Introduction

Accurately predicting the sign of gene–drug interactions (Activation vs. Inhibition) is crucial for drug repurposing and mechanistic interpretation. **CSIH** addresses the limitations of existing methods (which often ignore edge signs or rely on simple balance theory) by introducing:

1.  **Signed Hypergraph Learning**: Models complex high-order correlations between genes and drugs.
2.  **Disentangled Intent Encoder**: Decomposes interactions into $K$ latent biological intents.
3.  **Contrastive Regularization**: Enhances representation quality at both node and graph levels, specifically designed for sparse datasets.
